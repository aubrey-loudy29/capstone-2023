I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she knew exactly the look i was going for. She really listens and wants you to look your best. She definitely is a sweet soul. The results exceeded my expectations. I couldn't even believe it was my hair when we were done!")

Everything down to the care & styling was just the best! She was very nice and very professional. If you want someone who knows what they are doing & who is very knowledgeable pleas go to her. She's a gem. I'm beyond happy with how my hair turned out. Though I can say the service was pretty pricey I can say that the outcome was on point. Thank you Caroline!")

However, that feeling vanished quickly when I entered Elysian Salon. The staff was very welcoming, friendly, and attentive my entire time there. I couldn't be happier with my hair results. Rebekah was my hairstylist, I showed her a picture of what I wanted, and she delivered exactly that. Thank you so much for the beautiful work you did!")

Everyone is beyond professional, really personable, welcoming and the calibur of their skills is unfathomable. I've had plenty of bad hair experiences in the past, but this place never disappoints. Divina explained everything to me, answered all my hair questions, listened to what I wanted and also offered her professional hair coloring opinions based on my tone, face shape etc. Absolutely dreamy! This is what you call next level hair design. I'd suggest you make your way there pronto!")

I recommend Elysian Salon wholeheartedly. I only know Lizzie, but the other girls in the salon appear to love what they do and care about their clients. A great salon and a talented staff and leader.")
